/*
Index became a trait, because a default (fst-based) implementation cannot be modified after initial
construction. That doesn't play well with idea of index being filled with suggestions with delay.
An example of that use case is a fuzzy search in context of symbol. Some editing options will
be available by default, while code navigation options will become available only after successful
code analysis done by remote language server or after a succesful query to on-line service.
I want to display available options immediately, and then expand on them as soon as I get more
information.
