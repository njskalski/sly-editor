Readme

This is a work in progress project of a command line text editor. The goals are:
- support sublime-like editing experience
- minimal delays
- fuzzy search bars for:
  - file navigation
  - all options
  - options in given context (example: code symbol)
  * all key shortcuts customizable
  * all key shortcuts visualized to learn-as-you-use
- interstellar code navigation via language server protocol, services like kythe.io and custom scripts.
- syntax highlighting
- themes
- scripts for compiler output filtering to support "jump to error" or code annotations
- scripts for browsing the relevant api documentation, or even making queries about code in search services.
- nice default settings for best out-of-box experience
- strong focus on usability
- easy to learn

Future goals may include:
- more tool integration (I like debuggers)
- reading from non-file buffers
- modal editing, but more like Kakoune than Vim

I plan no support for:
- other encodings than utf-8 (at least in first versions)
- javascript plugins

The script language of choice will most probably be either Python or Go.

What is already done:
- reading and editing (but not saving) files
- thanks to the great libraries of fst and Cursive, fuzzy search bar already works
for files, other menus will be implemented soon.
- thanks to the great serde_json library, settings mechanism (including keybindings) is implemented.
- thanks to the great Ropey library the editing backend is already performing well, supporting
low overhead history (to support undo/redo).
- multi cursor editing, basic clipboard (only paste now) support

* there are also other great libraries this project uses, but it was "already done" section. See Cargo.toml for list of dependencies.
